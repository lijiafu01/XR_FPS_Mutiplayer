PREFABS

Each Prefab has its own animator with 5 animations idle, attack, hurt, walk, die


MOBILE OPTIMIZED PREFABS?
-------------------------
"Lowpoly Series Enemy" doesn't include mobile-specific prefabs.
This is because:
- mobile devices are much more powerful now so there is no need to optimize.
- prefabs are all already optimized and use a relatively small number of materials and textures.

DEMO

"Lowpoly Series Enemy 02" includes a demo scene to show you the Enemy_02 animations.
